## Innovation Summit Environmental Data Science Questions

1.  **EDS in Indian Country**  
    How can we effectively partner with tribal colleges and universities
    to integrate environmental data science (EDS) into their curricula
    and research programs, and empower Indigenous communities with the
    tools and knowledge necessary to tackle pressing environmental
    challenges and manage their natural resources sustainably?

2.  **Solving water**  
    How can inclusive environmental data science be leveraged to
    effectively address and solve the myriad of complex water-related
    challenges facing the world, such as water scarcity, pollution, and
    climate change impacts, and ensure equitable access to safe and
    clean water for all people?

3.  **Data librarianship**  
    What are the key unifying questions and challenges facing the
    emerging field of environmental data librarianship, which seeks to
    support researchers and organizations in the management, curation,
    and sharing of complex environmental and social data sets?

4.  **Cutting-edge remote sensing**  
    As remote sensing technology advances to provide increasing spatial
    resolution and access to previously unmeasured areas, how can we
    ensure that the collection and analysis of this data is leveraged to
    promote social justice by informing vulnerability assessments and
    supporting ecosystem function monitoring, and what ethical
    considerations must be taken into account as we navigate this
    rapidly evolving field?

5.  **Nature-based solutions and Human development**  
    As city planning increasingly turns towards nature-based solutions
    for sustainable development, how can the integration of big data and
    environmental data science accelerate the design and implementation
    of these solutions not only in urban areas but also in rural areas,
    and what advancements in technology, such as digital twins and
    complex systems models, could revolutionize the way we approach both
    urban and rural city planning and help us create more resilient and
    livable communities in the future?

6.  **Extreme events and hazards**  
    As extreme events such as fires, disease outbreaks, droughts,
    floods, and famines become more frequent and severe due to climate
    change, how can the integration of machine learning and
    environmental data science into hazard planning science enhance our
    ability to prepare for, mitigate, and respond to these events, and
    what are the emerging questions and challenges facing planners as
    they navigate the complexities of an uncertain and rapidly changing
    climate future?

7.  **Spatial scale**  
    How can we better bridge the gap between the fine-grained details
    and large-scale patterns in environmental data to improve our
    understanding of complex systems, and what new insights might we
    uncover by exploring the emergent properties/patterns that connect
    large and small spatial scales?

8.  **Data ethics**  
    As environmental data scientists navigate the ethical complexities
    of collecting, managing, and analyzing data in the 21st century,
    what are the most urgent and pressing data ethics issues that need
    to be addressed? What steps can we take to ensure that the benefits
    of environmental data science are accessible, equitable, and
    sustainable for all?

9.  **Ecological forecasting**  
    As the need for accurate biodiversity monitoring and ecological
    forecasting grows in urgency, how can environmental data scientists
    leverage advances in machine learning, large data repositories, and
    other emerging technologies to improve the precision and reliability
    of biodiversity monitoring and ecological forecasts, and what
    barriers and challenges must be overcome to ensure that these
    forecasts are both scientifically rigorous and practically
    applicable for informing environmental decision-making in the
    future?

10. **Data harmonization**  
    As the need for integrating and analyzing large and diverse datasets
    across different domains and scales grows in urgency, how can
    environmental data scientists push the boundaries of data
    harmonization to move from a world where harmonizing two datasets is
    a feat, to a world where harmonizing hundreds of dissimilar datasets
    in a rigorous and standardized way is the norm, and what are the key
    technological and cultural shifts

11. **Food supply**  
    As we face the dual challenges of ensuring food security for a
    growing global population and maintaining the ecological integrity
    of our food production systems, how can environmental data
    scientists leverage the power of real-time monitoring, machine
    learning, spatial complexity, and big data to enhance our
    understanding of the dynamics and resilience of food production
    systems, and how can we effectively integrate precision agriculture
    and high-tech animal husbandry practices into these data-driven
    approaches to optimize sustainability, productivity, and efficiency
    across the food production chain?

12. **Social justice**  
    As environmental data scientists grapple with the intertwined
    challenges of promoting social and environmental justice, harnessing
    the power of big data and machine learning, and upholding data
    ethics, what are the critical questions and ethical dilemmas that
    arise in designing and implementing data-driven solutions that
    address systemic inequities and environmental risks? How can we
    ensure that our data science methodologies are transparent,
    inclusive, and aligned with the values and priorities of
    marginalized communities, and how can we leverage the potential of
    big data and machine learning to drive transformative change towards
    a more just and sustainable future?

13. **Data science in decision making and policy**  
    As environmental data scientists strive to make their models and
    tools more practical for decision and policy makers, what are the
    key challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical advances and
    practical applications of machine learning and big data analytics?
    How can we ensure that our outputs are not only scientifically
    rigorous, but also useful and relevant to decision makers who are
    often constrained by limited time, resources, and data literacy? In
    this context, how can we prioritize the most critical needs and
    questions of society, while also advancing the frontiers of
    environmental data science?

14. **AI in environmental data science**  
    How can environmental data scientists pragmatically incorporate the
    latest advancements in artificial intelligence to automate data
    collection and analysis, and what are the ethical implications of
    these technologies? How can we ensure that the outcomes generated by
    AI-based environmental data science are aligned with human values
    and priorities, and how can we prepare for the potential disruptions
    that these advancements may bring to the field?

15. **Math, modeling, statistics**  
    How can we leverage existing mathematical techniques and develop new
    ones to uncover meaningful patterns in the vast amounts of
    environmental data we are collecting at larger scales, and how can
    we ensure that these patterns are not merely artifacts of
    statistical noise or biased sampling?

16. **EDS specific education**  
    As the field of Environmental Data Science continues to grow, what
    educational strategies should be employed to cultivate the necessary
    interdisciplinary skills for success? How can we balance the need
    for expertise in computer science, mathematical modeling, and
    geography with a deep understanding of the ecological, social, and
    planetary systems we seek to model? And, how do we ensure that
    students are equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary to
    navigate the ethical considerations that arise from working with big
    data in the environmental sciences?
