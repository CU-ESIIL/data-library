The lat-long data is reported on the NAD-83 datum.

Brian, thanks for the data.  I'd like to confirm that the lat/long data
are referenced by the NAD27 datum (or NAD83 datum).

Hi, Brian,

Thank you for the additional information and the quick response.  The
long./lat. information is critical.   Karl Hermann of our staff may have
additional questions for  you.

We appreciate all of your efforts.  Best Regards!  Doug

The data I sent previous had any known mine names.  Some of the names,
such
as "The Pile" are names applied to the site by the Wyoming AML.  I am
attaching another spreadsheet with the same data as before, but also a
decimal lat and long.
