Perimeter control efforts there have proven successful  as limited to no fire growth was reported. ,S,U,A dry cold front crossed into the fire area starting late Wednesday  bringing strong north  winds comparable to those that occurred when the fire moved into Montecito on the 16th.  The fire area has not received any rainfall over .10 inches since February. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to be set for this time of year. No precipitation is forecast for the foreseeable future. After the passage of the front  Santa Anas are expected to return.   A strong presence of suppression resources will continue to be in place during the period of the north wind event. At the time of this report  limited fire activity occurred with the increase in winds. The north winds are predicted to last into Thursday morning. The past three days of reduced fire behavior has allowed crews to continue securing the Montecito area effectively with tactical patrol and line improvement. Spots to the west of Gibralter Road have been contained and are being mopped up. The current north wind event will wind test these areas  as remnant heat will be fanned by strong wind.   Crews are mopping the Camino Cielo to strengthen the fireline there. To the north of Camino Cielo  direct and indirect line construction is ongoing toward the Zaca fire with cold trailing occurring as possible. Direct line construction is continuing within the Zaca fire footprint. From the Zaca Fire  a significant firing operation was hampered by west winds  interrupting the operation until favorable winds return. Firing to Rose Valley is estimated to take four days to complete. East of Rose Valley  will continue direct line construction  moving toward the Sespe Wilderness boundary.   North of the community of Fillmore fire behavior was minimal where it has backed into the Sespe drainage. To the north  the fire is slowly moving through the Sespe Wilderness and Bear Haven area  where it is being closely monitored.  Carpinteria  the Ojai Valley area  and Highway 126 between Highway 150 and Fillmore are all in patrol status. Resources have maintained a presence along the Highway 101 area  to the east of Fillmore to Highway 150.

This weather pattern will be conducive to west- and southward fire growth  continuing to threaten the communities of Santa Barbara  Montecito and Summerland in Santa Barbara County. Active fire and residual heat exposed to severe fire weather will continue to threaten So Cal Edison 220 kv transmission and distribution lines  as well as high-pressure natural gas lines and oil wells. Resources will continue construction of direct fireline above Montecito and Santa Barbara to keep fire from impacting these communities. Evacuations will continue to be issued ahead of fire growth.  North winds will also exasperate the threat to Fillmore and surrounding agricultural values  with fire being established in the Sespe drainage. So Cal Edison also has transmission lines in this vicinity. They have not been impacted by fire as of yet  but are threatened by the possibility of southerly fire spread.    Gusty winds could cause lingering hot spots to flare up in the areas of Ojai  Santa Paula  Casitas Springs  unincorporated areas of Ventura County  Murrietta Canyon and Matilija Canyon due to potential reignition of lingering hot spots.

It is progressing to the north in the North Fork Matilija and backing into Bear Haven. ,S,U,Very strong north winds materialized this morning around 0700 increasing fire behavior significantly in the Santa Barbara Front Country. Fire made an aggressive southward push into the community of Montecito  impacting some structures there. The fire has continued to experience single digit humidity with poor recovery. Additionally  the area has not received any rainfall over .10 inches for over 250 days. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for the foreseeable future. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds.   With ongoing critical weather conditions  the potential remains for south- and westward fire spread with an continuing threat to Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland. The north winds exasperated already difficult firefighting conditions  with winds gusting to 65 mph this morning in Montecito. A considerable structure defense operation with tactical patrol is in effect within the community of Montecito. Evacuation orders were issued today and planning continues for additional westward growth of the fire. Wind speeds precluded the use of air resources during the wind event. When conditions were safe to do so  air resources were used to limit spread  allowing firefighters to re-engage in perimeter control. Indirect line has been constructed as contingency if direct suppression efforts are unsuccessful  and is prepared for firing if needed. The fire is well established in Sycamore Canyon. Westward spread of the fire has crossed the prepared line at Gibralter and the contingency plan has been initiated for this area.    North of the Camino Cielo  line construction with firing operations has been successful and continues to progress northward to the Zaca footprint. Main fire activity in the area is very active. Fire did cross to to the north of this feature but was contained. Contingency lines are being prepared in this area as well.   North of the community of Fillmore fire behavior picked up where it has backed into the Sespe drainage. Indirect line construction is continuing with firing operations to secure the community from the fire's threat. To the north  the fire is moving through the Sespe Wilderness.  Construction of direct fireline is occurring on the northwestern side of the fire where it has burned into the sparser fuels of the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are improving Highway 33 as an indirect fireline in preparation for future firing operations. To the south of Highway 33  fire is continuing to back actively into the wind  which has been gusting into the 30s. This afternoon fire approached the highway to the west of Rose Valley  slopping over in a few areas. Crews have been able to secure these slops thus far. Implementation of the firing plan will occur tomorrow.  Where the fire crossed the highway near Rose Valley  crews are improving fireline to stem northward spread.  Firing operations from Rose Valley are progressing eastward toward the Sespe Drainage. On the northeastern side of the fire  spread has moderated considerably in the areas of Bear Wallow and the Day Fire.   In the Ojai Valley area  mop-up will continue to focus on isolated hot spots in and around the communities. There are burning natural oil seeps in the vicinity that resources are working to extinguish.

Scouting for establishment of indirect fireline will continue where needed. Both defensive and offensive firing operations will occur. The Sespe Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary remain a concern due to active fire in rugged terrain.    ,The weather trend is forecast to persist  with gusty Santa Ana winds continuing to battle with terrain driven winds. The highest potential for rapid fire growth will continue to be in the evening hours. The most significant fire growth will continue in the west  with continued potential for downhill runs into populated areas. Very high fuel loading  critically low fuel moistures  above average temperatures and poor humidity recovery will continue to support conditions conducive to extraordinary fire behavior. Fire growth will occur on the west  north and east sides of the Thomas Fire. Extreme fire behavior oscillating between wind- and plume-driven runs will continue to hamper control efforts. Firefighters will remain engaged in structure defense operations and scout for opportunities to establish direct perimeter control. Fire will continue to threaten the communities of Santa Barbara  Carpinteria  Summerland  Montecito and surrounding areas. Fireline construction to the north of these communities will continue.

In previously burned areas  continued mop-up operations will occur in order to expedite repopulation efforts. The area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status. Strengthening of firelines around the Ojai Valley area will continue  as communities will remain threatened by residual hot spots. In the east  outlying areas of Fillmore will remain threatened. Fire personnel will work to construct direct fireline with the support of aerial resources where possible on the east side of the fire.  Scouting for establishment of indirect fireline will continue where needed. Both defensive and offensive firing operations will occur. The Sespe Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary will remain a concern due to active backing fire in rugged terrain.      ,Severe fire weather is projected to continue through Thursday  supporting extreme fire behavior with fire growth to the west  north and east. Structure defense will continue and perimeter control lines will be established where possible. Direct line construction will occur in the northwestern side of the fire  in the light fuels of the Zaca Fire scar. Indirect line construction and improvement will continue to the north of the Matilija Wilderness in preparation for future firing operations. Contingency line construction will continue in the west and north sides of the fire. On the east side of the fire  line construction and improvement will occur. Mop-up will continue in order to expedite repopulation efforts and bolster control lines. Fire will continue to threaten the city of Santa Barbara  and the communities of Carpinteria  Summerland  Montecito and surrounding areas. Fire will progress westward into the Santa Ynez Mountains. Active backing in the north and east will continue to move fire into Sespe Wilderness and toward the Condor Sanctuary.    ,On Friday  a brief period of onshore flow is in the forecast. This should bring a moderate increase in relative humidity  decrease in temperature and  most notably  relief from the strong offshore winds. Critically low live fuel moistures will continue to sustain active fire behavior. Fire growth to the west  north and east will continue where lines have not been established. The reduction in winds should improve opportunities for direct line construction to occur and alleviate some of the threat to communities in the Santa Barbara area  albeit temporarily. Residual hot spots will will continue to threaten the city of Santa Barbara  and the communities of Carpinteria  Summerland  Montecito and surrounding areas. Mop-up operations will occur to mitigate the risk. Contingency line construction will continue in on the west and north sides of the fire. Direct fireline construction and improvement will occur on the eastern edge of the fire. Mop-up will continue in order to expedite repopulation efforts and bolster control lines.  ,After Friday  offshore flow is forecasted to return  bringing the possibilities for Sundowner winds. Sundowner winds bring to potential to considerably amplify fire behavior. This will be compounded by decreased humidities and increased temperatures brought by offshore flow. Operations will continue to secure the cities of Santa Barbara  Montecito  Carpinteria and surrounding areas from residual hot spots. Contingency line construction will progress in the west. Indirect line construction and improvement in the north will continue in preparation for firing operations. Fire spread along the northern flank will continue to follow topography in its movement north and into Santa Barbara County. Repopulation operations will continue.

Firing operations in the Casitas Lake area resulted in very active fire behavior. Very active fire behavior was observed in the Sespe Creek drainage. ,S,U,The fire area has gone 12 days with humidites remaining below 20 percent. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for 248 days. These conditions have driven live fuel moistures far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds  setting the stage for unprecedented fire behavior.  The west side of the fire has experienced significant growth threatening communities extending to the city of Santa Barbara. The rapid fire growth continues to preclude the use of direct attack in many areas. In an effort to keep the fire out of the populated areas in Santa Barbara County  line construction is occurring to the north of these communities with an intent to tie in to the Camino Cielo fuel break. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation orders are continuing to be issued ahead of westward growth of the fire. The Camino Cielo fuel break is being improved for use as fireline and contingency lines are  being prepared. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain a persistent threat and cause for concern  as they are currently the sole remaining source of electricity for many of the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County.   Attempts to construct direct fireline are occurring on the northern side of the fire where it has burned into the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are constructing indirect line in preparation for future firing operations. On the eastern side of the fire  active fire behavior and rugged terrain have presented a challenge to suppression efforts northwest of the community of Fillmore. Direct and indirect line construction is occurring in this area  with offensive and defensive firing operations being utilized. The fire is less active within the Sespe Wilderness and is being monitored.  In the Ojai Valley area  fire is being managed as it backs down to Highway 150 from Lake Casitas to Highway 101  which will effectively create a continuous circle of black around the communities there. Crews are actively mopping up to bolster existing firelines.   Incident Management Team 4 personnel have  and continue to  work closely with local area fire  law enforcement and Emergency Management to create a cohesive and dynamic response plan.  ,Keep the fire north of the 101 Fwy and Hwy 126 Keep the fire South of Mount Pinos Ranger District Boundary Keep the fire East of Hwy 154 and the 9N11 Keep the fire west of Piru Canyon ,12/12/2017 19:53:39,"South Ops, SLU, VCFD",Y,Y,,Northeast to east winds  gusting between 15 to 25 MPH  prevailed this morning.

To the south of Camino Cielo  fire continued to move  spotting north of the Camino Cielo.,S,U,The fire has continued to experience single digit humidity with poor recovery. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for over 250 days. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds.   With ongoing critical weather conditions  the threat remains for westward growth with an ongoing threat to Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland. The forecasted Sundowner wind did not materialize  allowing for continued successful direct attack to continue. Air resources are being used to limit westward progression of the fire  allowing direct line construction to progress to the west above the populated areas. Indirect line has been constructed as contingency if direct suppression efforts are unsuccessful  and is prepared for firing if needed. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation planning is continuing and orders will be issued as needed ahead of westward growth of the fire.   North of the Camino Cielo  line construction with firing operations has been successful and continues to progress northward to the Zaca footprint. Contingency lines are  being prepared in this area as well. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain persistently threatened  as they run east and west through the fire area in Santa Barbara County. Firing operations along Agua Caliente in the northwest were successful.  North of the community of Fillmore fire has backed into the Sespe drainage. Indirect line construction with firing operations to secure the community from the fire's threat were successful. Mop-up is occurring.  Construction of direct fireline is occurring on the northwestern side of the fire where it has burned into the sparser fuels of the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are improving Highway 33 as an indirect fireline in preparation for future firing operations. Where the fire crossed the highway near Rose Valley  crews are constructing direct fireline to stem northward spread. Firing operations from Rose Valley are progressing eastward. On the northeastern side of the fire  spread has moderated considerably in the areas of Bear Wallow and the Day Fire.   In the Ojai Valley area  mop-up will continue to focus on isolated hot spots in and around the communities. There are burning natural oil seeps in the vicinity that resources are working to extinguish.

In the north  fire will continue to progress through available fuels under forecast dry conditions and poor overnight relative humidity recovery. Fire continues to burn through available fuels in the inaccessible Bear Haven area above the Sespe drainage. Fire activity is expected to increase with fire conditions that will promote fire spread. ,S,U,The dry cold front moved through the area on December 20 and was replaced by weak offshore flow. Winds gusting to 50 miles per hour tested firelines in the south  with no notable fire activity in the Montecito area  Camino Cielo or Fillmore. A persistent offshore flow will bring low relative humidity and above average temperatures to the fire area for several days. Fire behavior will  increase over the next few days with the lowering relative humidity.   The fire area has not received any rainfall over .10 inches since February. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels. ERCs have dipped with the recent humidity recovery but will begin to increase with continued offshore flow.   Crews are mopping the Camino Cielo to strengthen the fireline there. To the north of Camino Cielo  crews will patrol the fire line in the Zaca fire area  and monitor fire spread where line construction has not been possible due to very rough terrain. The firing operation from the past few days will be mopped up and patrolled.    North of the community of Fillmore fire behavior has been was minimal where it has backed into the Sespe drainage. Fire spread east of Rose Valley to Bear Haven will be monitored by air. Fire spread has been minimal in this area for the last week  with IR information corroborating that intel. To the north  the fire is slowly moving through the Sespe Wilderness and Bear Haven area  where it is being closely monitored.

Fire suppression repair will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.  ,Primary efforts on the Thomas Fire will be focused in the north. Planning for firing will continue and resources will remain ready to initiate burn operations when necessary. If the operations above the communities around Montecito and the Fillmore area are effective  mop up along the perimeter will occur to strengthen fireline. Resources will also mop-up in and around affected communities to support repopulation of those areas. Fire progression in the Sespe Wilderness will be monitored. Repopulation and evacuation planning is ongoing. Fire suppression repair will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.  ,200000000.0,,,,A fatality of a CAL FIRE employee occurred on the fire on 12/14/2017. A Serious Accident Review Team is investigating the incident.   Direct Protection Area by group: (Based on best available information at time of submittal)  Federal- 61% State- 38% Local- 1%  CAL FIRE Incident Management Team 4 (Derum) and California Interagency Incident Management Team 4 (Kurth) are working as an integrated team to manage this incident.   A second camp has been opened in Santa Barbara to support operations across the large expanse of the fire area. The boil water order has been lifted. ,12/15/2017 8:00:00,,2017-12-15 19:30:00,Y,4495913.0,Fire continues to move north along Highway 33. Creeping movement above Santa Barbara occurred on Santa Ynez Ridge. ,S,U,The fire has continued to experience single digit humidity with poor recovery. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for over 250 days. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds and forecasted sundowner winds developing in Santa Barbara County tonight  setting the stage for unprecedented fire behavior.   With ongoing critical weather conditions  the threat remains for westward growth with an ongoing threat to Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland. The forecasted Sundowner wind event will exasperate already difficult firefighting conditions  making the next 36 hours a highly critical time period for this area. Air resources are being used to limit westward progression of the fire  allowing direct line construction to progress to the west above the populated areas. Indirect line has been constructed as contingency if direct suppression efforts are unsuccessful  and is prepared for firing if needed. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation planning is continuing and orders will be issued as needed ahead of westward growth of the fire.   North of the Camino Cielo  line construction with firing operations has been successful and continues to progress northward to the Zaca footprint. Contingency lines are  being prepared in this area as well. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain persistently threatened  as they run east and west through the fire area in Santa Barbara County.   North of the community of Fillmore fire has backed into the Sespe drainage. Indirect line construction is occurring in preparation for firing operations to secure the community from the fire's threat when the forecasted north winds materialize.  Construction of direct fireline is occurring on the northwestern side of the fire where it has burned into the sparser fuels of the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are improving Highway 33 as an indirect fireline in preparation for future firing operations. Where the fire crossed the highway near Rose Valley  crews are constructing direct fireline to stem northward spread. Firing operations from Rose Valley are progressing eastward. On the northeastern side of the fire  spread has moderated considerably in the areas of Bear Wallow and the Day Fire.   In the Ojai Valley area  mop-up will continue to focus on isolated hot spots in and around the communities. There are burning natural oil seeps in the vicinity that resources are working to extinguish.   Resources have maintained a presence along the Highway 101 area  to the east of Fillmore to Highway 150.  Incident Management Team 4  integrated with California Interagency Incident Management Team 4  continue to work closely with local area fire  law enforcement and Emergency Management to maintain a cohesive and dynamic response plan.   ,Keep the fire North of the 101 Fwy and Hwy 126. Keep the fire South of Mount Pinos Ranger District Boundary. Keep the fire East of Hwy 154 and the 9N11. Keep the fire West of Piru Canyon. ,12/15/2017 19:39:32,"South Ops, SLU, VCFD",Y,Y,,Weak northeast winds  gusting between 15 and 25 MPH  prevailed across the area with the strongest winds across the Ventura zone.

Fire will progress westward into the Santa Ynez Mountains. Active backing in the north and east will continue to move fire into Sespe Wilderness and toward the Condor Sanctuary.    ,A brief period of onshore flow is expected around Friday. This will bring somewhat higher humidites  reducing fire behavior. Opportunities for direct fireline construction will increase with the decrease in fire behavior. Aggressive mop-up and patrol of residual heat will continue to support repopulation efforts in Santa Barbara County and the area of Fillmore.  After Friday  offshore flow is forecasted to return  bringing the potential for Sundowner winds. Sundowner winds bring to potential to considerably amplify fire behavior. This will be compounded by decreased humidities and increased temperatures brought by offshore flow.   Fire spread along the northern flank will continue to follow topography in its movement north and into Santa Barbara County. Efforts will continue to halt progression east towards the Sespe Condor Sanctuary and Wilderness.    ,120000000.0,,,,Moderated weather brought little growth to the fire perimeter.

Persistent low humidities allowed fire to back actively against the wind.,S,U,The fire area has gone 11 days with humidities remaining below 20 percent. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for 247 days. These conditions have driven live fuel moistures far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds.   Last night  offshore winds strengthened  causing the fire to make runs in the Toro Canyon area  impacting structures there.   The west side of the fire has experienced significant growth threatening communities extending to the city of Santa Barbara. The rapid fire growth continues to preclude the use of direct attack in many areas. Line construction to the north of the communities in Santa Barbara County is occurring in an effort to keep the fire out of populated areas. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation orders are continuing to be issued ahead of westward growth of the fire. The Camino Cielo is being improved for use as fireline and contingency lines are  being prepared. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain a persistent threat and cause for concern  as they are the sole remaining source of electricity for much of the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County.   In the Ojai Valley area  crews conducted firing operations along Hwy 150 in an effort to stem fire spread up-valley. Crews continue to actively mop up existing firelines.   On the east side of the fire above Fillmore  fire continues to burn actively against the wind. Steep  rugged terrain and roll-out continue to pose problems for direct fireline construction.   Attempts to construct direct fireline are occurring on the northern side of the fire using hand crews in the rugged terrain. A contingency line is being prepared further to the north. On the eastern side of the fire  active fire behavior and rugged terrain have presented a challenge to suppression efforts northwest of the community of Fillmore. Direct and indirect line construction is occurring in this area  proceeding to the north.

Direct line construction  where possible  will continue on the northern side of the fire within the Zaca Fire burn scar. To north of the Matilija Wilderness  indirect line construction will continue in preparation for future burn operations. In previously burned areas  continued mop-up operations will occur in order to expedite repopulation efforts. The area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status. Along Highway 150 crews will mop up the perimeter of the firing operation that occurred last night and today and manage the fire backing to the highway. Ojai  Casitas Springs  Oak View and Matilija Canyon will remain threatened by residual hot spots. In the east  outlying areas of Fillmore will remain threatened. Fire personnel will work to construct direct fireline with the support of aerial resources where possible on the east side of the fire.  Scouting for establishment of indirect fireline will continue where needed. Both defensive and offensive firing operations will occur. The Sespe Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary remain a concern due to active fire in rugged terrain.    ,The weather trend is forecast to persist  with gusty Santa Ana winds continuing to battle with terrain driven winds. The highest potential for rapid fire growth will continue to be in the evening hours. The most significant fire growth will continue in the west  with continued potential for downhill runs into populated areas. Very high fuel loading  critically low fuel moistures  above average temperatures and poor humidity recovery will continue to support conditions conducive to extraordinary fire behavior. Fire growth will occur on the west  north and east sides of the Thomas Fire. Extreme fire behavior oscillating between wind- and plume-driven runs will continue to hamper control efforts. Firefighters will remain engaged in structure defense operations and scout for opportunities to establish direct perimeter control.

In previously burned areas  continued mop-up operations will occur in order to expedite repopulation efforts. The area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status. Strengthening of firelines around the Ojai Valley area will continue  as communities will remain threatened by residual hot spots. In the east  outlying areas of Fillmore will remain threatened. Fire personnel will work to construct direct fireline with the support of aerial resources where possible on the east side of the fire.  Scouting for establishment of indirect fireline will continue where needed. Both defensive and offensive firing operations will occur. The Sespe Wilderness and the Sespe Condor Sanctuary will remain a concern due to active backing fire in rugged terrain.      ,Severe fire weather is projected to continue through Thursday  with strengthening of Santa Ana winds. This will increase the potential for extreme fire behavior with fire growth to the west  north and east. Structure defense will continue and perimeter control lines will be established where possible. Direct line construction will occur in the northwestern side of the fire  in the light fuels of the Zaca Fire scar. Indirect line construction and improvement will continue to the north of the Matilija Wilderness in preparation for future firing operations. Contingency line construction will continue in the west and north sides of the fire. On the east side of the fire  line construction and improvement will occur. Mop-up will continue in order to expedite repopulation efforts and bolster control lines. Fire will continue to threaten the city of Santa Barbara  and the communities of Carpinteria  Summerland  Montecito and surrounding areas. Fire will progress westward into the Santa Ynez Mountains. Active backing in the north and east will continue to move fire into Sespe Wilderness and toward the Condor Sanctuary.    ,On Friday  a brief period of onshore flow is in the forecast. This should bring a moderate increase in relative humidity  decrease in temperature and  most notably  relief from the strong offshore winds. Critically low live fuel moistures will continue to sustain active fire behavior. Fire growth to the west  north and east will continue where lines have not been established. The reduction in winds should improve opportunities for direct line construction to occur and alleviate some of the threat to communities in the Santa Barbara area  albeit temporarily. Residual hot spots will will continue to threaten the city of Santa Barbara  and the communities of Carpinteria  Summerland  Montecito and surrounding areas. Mop-up operations will occur to mitigate the risk. Contingency line construction will continue in on the west and north sides of the fire. Direct fireline construction and improvement will occur on the eastern edge of the fire. Mop-up will continue in order to expedite repopulation efforts and bolster control lines.  ,After Friday  offshore flow is forecasted to return  bringing the possibilities for Sundowner winds. Sundowner winds bring to potential to considerably amplify fire behavior. This will be compounded by decreased humidities and increased temperatures brought by offshore flow. Operations will continue to secure the cities of Santa Barbara  Montecito  Carpinteria and surrounding areas from residual hot spots. Contingency line construction will progress in the west. Indirect line construction and improvement in the north will continue in preparation for firing operations. Fire spread along the northern flank will continue to follow topography in its movement north and into Santa Barbara County. Repopulation operations will continue. Fire spread in the Sespe Wilderness will be monitored. ,120000000.0,,,,Significant resource demobilization from other incidents has assisted in meeting control objectives.

In the early morning hours fire above Carpinteria increased in activity.   The fire area has gone 12 days with humidites remaining below 20 percent. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for 248 days. These conditions have driven live fuel moistures far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds  setting the stage for unprecedented fire behavior.  The west side of the fire has experienced significant growth threatening communities extending to the city of Santa Barbara. The rapid fire growth continues to preclude the use of direct attack in many areas. In an effort to keep the fire out of the populated areas in Santa Barbara County  line construction is occurring to the north of these communities with an intent to tie in to the Camino Cielo fuel break. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation orders are continuing to be issued ahead of westward growth of the fire. The Camino Cielo fuel break is being improved for use as fireline and contingency lines are  being prepared. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain a persistent threat and cause for concern  as they are currently the sole remaining source of electricity for many of the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County.   Attempts to construct direct fireline are occurring on the northern side of the fire where it has burned into the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are constructing indirect line in preparation for future firing operations. On the eastern side of the fire  active fire behavior and rugged terrain have presented a challenge to suppression efforts northwest of the community of Fillmore. Direct and indirect line construction is occurring in this area  with offensive and defensive firing operations being utilized. The fire is less active within the Sespe Wilderness and is being monitored.  In the Ojai Valley area  fire is being managed as it backs down to Highway 150 from Lake Casitas to Highway 101  which will effectively create a continuous circle of black around the communities there. Crews are actively mopping up to bolster existing firelines.   Incident Management Team 4 personnel have  and continue to  work closely with local area fire  law enforcement and Emergency Management to create a cohesive and dynamic response plan.  ,Keep the fire north of the 101 Fwy and Hwy 126 Keep the fire South of Mount Pinos Ranger District Boundary Keep the fire East of Hwy 154 and the 9N11 Keep the fire west of Piru Canyon ,12/13/2017 7:44:08,"South Ops, SLU, VCFD",Y,Y,,Northeast to east winds  gusting between 15 and 30 MPH  developed last night and this morning.

In previously burned areas  continued mop-up operations will occur in order to expedite repopulation efforts  which are ongoing. Planning for evacuation is ongoing as well.   Contingency line construction will continue on the west and north sides of the fire. Contingency groups will improve existing fuel breaks in Santa Barbara County  particularly in the areas of Windy Gap and Foothills.   Fire suppression repair and Damage Inspection will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.  Repopulation will continue as threats in previously evacuated areas decreases.  ,Critical fire weather will continue over the fire area  but northeast winds will abate  yielding to typical diurnal flow. The critically low live fuel moistures will continue to sustain active fire behavior. Areas of concern will remain  coastal Santa Barbara County communities  Matilija Wilderness  Rose Valley  and Sespe river drainage north of Fillmore.   For the Santa Barbara County coastal communities  fire resources will continue direct line construction  structure protection  and tactical patrol operations. Resources will remain poised to evacuate areas ahead of fire spread if needed. Firing of the indirect line north of Camino Cielo connecting to the lighter fuels of the Zaca Fire footprint will continue.   In the north  direct and indirect line construction will continue north of the Matilija Wilderness  along Hwy 33  and east into Rose Valley. Direct line construction  where possible  will continue within the Zaca Fire burn scar to Highway 33. Firing operations will commence and are expected to be ongoing for several operational shifts. Fire spread within the areas of Bear Haven and the Day Fire will be closely monitored. East of Rose Valley firefighters will remain engaged in direct line construction  heading to the Sespe Wilderness.   In the east  firefighters will improve the fireline that has been established to keep the fire out of the outlying areas of Fillmore. Indirect and direct line extending north from Fillmore will continue  in preparation for future firing operations if needed. Crews will construct direct and indirect fireline around the spot fire east of Sespe River. Fire progression towards the Sespe River drainage north of Fillmore will remain a concern. Mop-up operations in previously burned areas will be ongoing.   The area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status.

Fire suppression repair and damage inspection will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.  Repopulation will continue as threats in previously evacuated areas decreases. ,Typical diurnal wind rhythms will continue. However  combined with the very low fuel moisture  the potential for active fire behavior will remain. Operations will continue to minimize the threat to the cities of Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland in the west and Fillmore in the east  by constructing and improving control lines and mopping up residual hot spots. Firing to the north of Camino Cielo will continue and contingency line construction will progress in the west.   In the north  firing operations will be ongoing based upon weather conditions. Direct line construction in the Zaca Fire area will be continued if not completed. Mop-up of the direct line north of Rose Valley will continue. Firing operations along Highway 33 from Pine Mountain to Rose Valley will continue based on fire behavior and weather conditions.  In the area north of Fillmore  fireline construction and mop-up will continue if not yet complete and firing operations to secure the line may commence if favorable conditions exist. The spot fire east of Sespe River will be monitored for hot spots.  The area between Fillmore and Ventura along Highway 126 will remain in patrol status. Mop-up around the Ojai Valley area will continue  as communities remain threatened by residual hot spots. Fire spread in the Bear Haven area will be monitored. Repopulation and evacuation planning is ongoing. In previously burned areas  continued mop-up operations will occur in order to expedite repopulation efforts  which are ongoing.   Fire suppression repair and Damage Inspection will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.   ,A dry cold front may pass over the fire during this operational period followed by a north wind event in the afternoon. Combined with the very low fuel moisture  the potential for an increase in extreme fire behavior will remain.   In the west  line improvement and tactical patrol will be ongoing within the populated areas to reduce threat to life and property and expedite repopulation efforts. If efforts in the west are successful in halting fire progression  primary efforts will shift to the northern area of the fire.   In the north and east  direct and Indirect line construction and firing operations will continue based on fire behavior and weather. Primary areas of activity will be Hwy 33 north of Matilija Wilderness  Rose Valley  and Sespe River drainage. Holding and mopup of the fire perimeter in the Sespe River drainage to the north of Fillmore will be ongoing. Fire progression in the Sespe Wilderness will be monitored. Patrol of the Ojai Valley area and the coastal communities along Highway 101 in Ventura County will continue.   Planning for both evacuation and repopulation is ongoing. Fire suppression repair and Damage Inspection will continue as appropriate based on fire conditions.  , If operations to protect life and property in the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County are successful  the primary efforts will be focused in the north. Line construction and planning for firing operations will continue and resources will remain ready to initiate burn operations when necessary. Resources will continue mop-up in and around affected communities to support repopulation of those areas. Fire progression in the Sespe Wilderness will be monitored. Repopulation and evacuation planning is ongoing.

Primary fire growth occurred in the Matilija Wilderness and San Ysidro Canyon area.,S,U,Over the reporting period  the fire continued its slow but steady progression to the north  into the wilderness areas. The fire continues to back towards highway 33. In the Santa Barbara Zone  the fire continued to be active in the San Ysidro canyon  with roll out and short upslope runs. Due to better air quality on the western edge of the fire  air craft was able to make retardant drops during the day which was successful in slowing fire progression over the night burn period.    The fire has consistently experienced single digit humidites with poor recovery. Additionally  the area has not received any rainfall over .10 inches for 249 days. These conditions have driven live fuel moistures far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds and forecasted Sundowner winds developing in Santa Barbara County  setting the stage for unprecedented fire behavior.  The west side of the fire had experienced significant growth extending into Santa Barbara County during previous burn periods. With ongoing red flag conditions  the threat remains for significant westward growth with ongoing threat to Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland. In an effort to keep the fire out of the populated areas in Santa Barbara County  direct line construction efforts are occurring to the north of these communities with an intent to tie in to the Tea Fire and Jesusita Fire footprints. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation orders are continuing to be issued as needed ahead of westward growth of the fire. After this area has been secured  focus will shift to halting fire spread to the north of the Camino Ceilo. The Camino Cielo fuel break has improved for use as fireline and contingency lines are  being prepared. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain a persistent threat and cause for concern  as they are currently the sole remaining source of electricity for many of the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County.   Construction of direct fireline is occurring on the northern side of the fire where it has burned into the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are constructing indirect line in preparation for future firing operations. On the eastern side of the fire  spread has moderated considerably in the areas of Bear Wallow and the Day Fire. North of the community of Fillmore  indirect line construction is occurring.  In the Ojai Valley area  mop-up will continue in and around the communities to decrease the risk to infrastructure and to bolster existing firelines.   Repopulation is ongoing as the fire threat to life safety is reduced by suppression efforts.

Above the coastal communities in Santa Barbara County  the fire has become well established in San Ysidro Canyon. Additionally  very active backing fire crossed Highway 33 in the Rose Valley area.  ,S,U,Fire behavior increased today on the Thomas fire  progressing the fire toward the Sespe drainage north of Fillmore. In the Rose Valley area  fire crossed Highway 33 and has become established there. Additionally  fire became well-established in the San Ysidro Canyon  above the community of Montecito.   The fire has continued to experience single digit humidity with poor recovery. Additionally  the area had not received any rainfall over .10 inches for 250 days. Live fuel conditions are far below critical levels  with record ERCs continuing to trend upward. No precipitation is forecast for at least ten days. The fire environment has been further compounded by the persistent Santa Ana winds and forecasted sundowner winds developing in Santa Barbara County  setting the stage for unprecedented fire behavior. Moderate Sundowner winds are forecast for tomorrow evening in Santa Barbara County.   With ongoing red flag conditions  the threat remains for significant westward growth with ongoing threat to Santa Barbara  Montecito  and Summerland. Air resources were able to keep westward progression of the fire in check  allowing direct line construction to progress in an effort to keep fire out of the populated areas. Structure defense operations continue within these communities. Evacuation planning is continuing and orders will be issued as needed ahead of westward growth of the fire. North of the Camino Cielo  direct line construction has been successful and continues to progress northward to the Zaca footprint. Contingency lines are  being prepared. SoCal Edison transmission lines remain persistently threatened  as they run east and west through the fire area in Santa Barbara County.   Construction of direct fireline is occurring on the northern side of the fire where it has burned into the Zaca Fire footprint. To the north of the rugged Matilija Wilderness  crews are improving Highway 33 as an indirect fireline in preparation for future firing operations. Where the fire crossed the highway near Rose Valley  crews are constructing direct fireline to stem northward spread. A firing operation along Highway 33 is progressing to the east from Rose Valley. On the northeastern side of the fire  spread has moderated considerably because of sparse fuels in the areas of Bear Wallow and the Day Fire.   North of the community of Fillmore  indirect line construction is occurring in preparation for firing operations to secure the community from the fire's threat.   In the Ojai Valley area  mop-up will continue in and around the communities to diminish the risk to infrastructure and to bolster existing firelines.   Resources have maintained a presence along the Highway 101 area  to the east of Fillmore to Highway 150.  Incident Management Team 4  integrated with California Interagency Incident Management Team 4  continue to work closely with local area fire  law enforcement and Emergency Management to create a cohesive and dynamic response plan.   ,Keep the fire North of the 101 Fwy and Hwy 126.
