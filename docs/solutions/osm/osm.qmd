## Basic streetmap from Open Street Map
R Code:
```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Load the "osmdata" package for mapping
library(osmdata)
library(tmap)

# Define the map location and zoom level
bbox <- c(left = -0.16, bottom = 51.49, right = -0.13, top = 51.51)

# Get the OpenStreetMap data
osm_data <- opq(bbox) %>% 
  add_osm_feature(key = "highway") %>% 
  osmdata_sf()

# Plot the map using tmap
tm_shape(osm_data$osm_lines) + 
  tm_lines()
```
Python code:
```{python, cache=TRUE}
# Load the "osmnx" package for mapping
import osmnx as ox

# Define the map location and zoom level
bbox = (51.49, -0.16, 51.51, -0.13)

# Get the OpenStreetMap data
osm_data = ox.graph_from_bbox(north=bbox[2], south=bbox[0], east=bbox[3], west=bbox[1], network_type='all')

# Plot the map using osmnx
ox.plot_graph(osm_data)
```

In both cases, we define the map location and zoom level, retrieve the OpenStreetMap data using the specified bounding box, and plot the map.

The main differences between the two approaches are:

Package names and syntax: In R, we use the osmdata package and its syntax to download and process the OpenStreetMap data, while in Python, we use the osmnx package and its syntax.
Mapping libraries: In R, we use the tmap package to create a static map of the OpenStreetMap data, while in Python, we use the built-in ox.plot_graph function from the osmnx package to plot the map.
