## Innovation Summit Environmental Data Science Questions

1. **EDS in Indian Country**  
   How can we effectively partner with tribal colleges and universities to integrate environmental data science (EDS) into their curricula and research programs, and empower Indigenous communities with the tools and knowledge necessary to tackle pressing environmental challenges and manage their natural resources sustainably?

2. **Solving water**  
   How can inclusive environmental data science be leveraged to effectively address and solve the myriad of complex water-related challenges facing the world, such as water scarcity, pollution, and climate change impacts, and ensure equitable access to safe and clean water for all people?

3. **Data librarianship**  
   What are the key unifying questions and challenges facing the emerging field of environmental data librarianship, which seeks to support researchers and organizations in the management, curation, and sharing of complex environmental and social data sets?

4. **Cutting-edge remote sensing**  
   As remote sensing technology advances to provide increasing spatial resolution and access to previously unmeasured areas, how can we ensure that the collection and analysis of this data is leveraged to promote social justice by informing vulnerability assessments and supporting ecosystem function monitoring, and what ethical considerations must be taken into account as we navigate this rapidly evolving field?

5. **Nature-based solutions and Human development**  
   As city planning increasingly turns towards nature-based solutions for sustainable development, how can the integration of big data and environmental data science accelerate the design and implementation of these solutions not only in urban areas but also in rural areas, and what advancements in technology, such as digital twins and complex systems models, could revolutionize the way we approach both urban and rural city planning and help us create more resilient and livable communities in the future?

6. **Extreme events and hazards**  
   As extreme events such as fires, disease outbreaks, droughts, floods, and famines become more frequent and severe due to climate change, how can the integration of machine learning and environmental data science into hazard planning science enhance our ability to prepare for, mitigate, and respond to these events, and what are the emerging questions and challenges facing planners as they navigate the complexities of an uncertain and rapidly changing climate future?

7. **Spatial scale**  
   How can we better bridge the gap between the fine-grained details and large-scale patterns in environmental data to improve our understanding of complex systems, and what new insights might we uncover by exploring the emergent properties/patterns that connect large and small spatial scales?

8. **Data ethics**  
   As environmental data scientists navigate the ethical complexities of collecting, managing, and analyzing data in the 21st century, what are the most urgent and pressing data ethics issues that need to be addressed? What steps can we take to ensure that the benefits of environmental data science are accessible, equitable, and sustainable for all?

9. **Ecological forecasting**  
   As the need for accurate biodiversity monitoring and ecological forecasting grows in urgency, how can environmental data scientists leverage advances in machine learning, large data repositories, and other emerging technologies to improve the precision and reliability of biodiversity monitoring and ecological forecasts, and what barriers and challenges must be overcome to ensure that these forecasts are both scientifically rigorous and practically applicable for informing environmental decision-making in the future?

10. **Data harmonization**  
    As the need for integrating and analyzing large and diverse datasets across different domains and scales grows in urgency, how can environmental data scientists push the boundaries of data harmonization to move from a world where harmonizing two datasets is a feat, to a world where harmonizing hundreds of dissimilar datasets in a rigorous and standardized way is the norm, and what are the key technological and cultural shifts


11. **Food supply**  
    As we face the dual challenges of ensuring food security for a growing global population and maintaining the ecological integrity of our food production systems, how can environmental data scientists leverage the power of real-time monitoring, machine learning, spatial complexity, and big data to enhance our understanding of the dynamics and resilience of food production systems, and how can we effectively integrate precision agriculture and high-tech animal husbandry practices into these data-driven approaches to optimize sustainability, productivity, and efficiency across the food production chain?

12. **Social justice**  
    As environmental data scientists grapple with the intertwined challenges of promoting social and environmental justice, harnessing the power of big data and machine learning, and upholding data ethics, what are the critical questions and ethical dilemmas that arise in designing and implementing data-driven solutions that address systemic inequities and environmental risks? How can we ensure that our data science methodologies are transparent, inclusive, and aligned with the values and priorities of marginalized communities, and how can we leverage the potential of big data and machine learning to drive transformative change towards a more just and sustainable future?

13. **Data science in decision making and policy**  
    As environmental data scientists strive to make their models and tools more practical for decision and policy makers, what are the key challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical advances and practical applications of machine learning and big data analytics? How can we ensure that our outputs are not only scientifically rigorous, but also useful and relevant to decision makers who are often constrained by limited time, resources, and data literacy? In this context, how can we prioritize the most critical needs and questions of society, while also advancing the frontiers of environmental data science?

14. **AI in environmental data science**  
    How can environmental data scientists pragmatically incorporate the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to automate data collection and analysis, and what are the ethical implications of these technologies? How can we ensure that the outcomes generated by AI-based environmental data science are aligned with human values and priorities, and how can we prepare for the potential disruptions that these advancements may bring to the field?

15. **Math, modeling, statistics**  
    How can we leverage existing mathematical techniques and develop new ones to uncover meaningful patterns in the vast amounts of environmental data we are collecting at larger scales, and how can we ensure that these patterns are not merely artifacts of statistical noise or biased sampling?

16. **EDS specific education**  
    As the field of Environmental Data Science continues to grow, what educational strategies should be employed to cultivate the necessary interdisciplinary skills for success? How can we balance the need for expertise in computer science, mathematical modeling, and geography with a deep understanding of the ecological, social, and planetary systems we seek to model? And, how do we ensure that students are equipped with the critical thinking skills necessary to navigate the ethical considerations that arise from working with big data in the environmental sciences?
